# Introduction
In the world of specialty coffee, coffee is much more than a quick source of caffeine in the morning. Enthusiasts tend to have a methodical approach to their coffee preparation that involves the control of many variables with the goal of producing a bright and flavorful cup of coffee. Some of these variables include coffee bean variety, grind size, water mineral content, water temperature, pour technique, timing of pours, and agitation of the coffee ground bed. During the brewing process, managing these factors can become a headache, especially because of its time sensitivity. Although apps exist for different brew styles (Aeropress, espresso), there is a market gap for a brew guide aimed at pour over coffee. Existing apps lack nuances specific to pour overs and additionally do not faciliate meaningful data tracking, hindering users' ability to dial in coffee to perfection.

Our app aims to target the market gap in pour over coffee brew guides to provide enthusiasts with simple tool they can use for their daily brewing. There are several features our ideal app will support: the ability for users to add bags of coffee to their account; the ability for users to add, edit, and delete pour over recipes to be used in the brew guide; the ability for users to use their recipes in a timer-like guide that prompts certain brewing actions at certain time points; and the ability to log data on their coffee. The dashboard feature aims to incorporate visualizations on bags of coffee and lifetime coffee statistics, some being:
- Radar graph of acidity, clarity, flavor, bitterness, and sweetness of a bag of coffee
- Tree graph of total cups of coffee drank of a certain variety, location, or processing method.
- Map of all countries the user has purchased coffee from
- Rankings of coffees of a certain location, variety, or processing method based on user scoring


# Anticipated Technologies

This application is best suited for mobile use, but due to the timeframe of the project, lack of mobile development experience of our team, and difficulty of getting apps published on mobile devices, we opted to create a Progressive Web App (PWA). PWA's offer a mobile-like user experience but are created from web technologies, a strength of our team. Furthermore, PWA's offer offline functionality, push notifications, and a home screen icon, making them a strong candidate for our team compared to a mobile-specific stack.

Our team has selected a conventional technology stack of Node, Express, React, and Postgres. This stack was chosen for is ease of use, prevalence, active communities, and robust documentation. Additional tool we intend to use are Tailwind for CSS, Vite as a front-end build tool, and Vite-PWA for managing the PWA service-worker. Time permitting, IndexedDB is a NoSQL database that is stored in mobile devices' browsers, permitting a great offline experience that could be implemented.

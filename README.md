# Team Coffee

In the world of specialty coffee, enthusiasts go to great lengths to perfect their pour over recipes and techniques, often by logging brew data and tweaking recipes. Given the lack of a pour over specific brew guide, our project aims to create Progressive Web App (PWA) that allows users to log the coffee beans they've purchased, create recipes for those beans, use their recipes in a timer-like guide which prompts certain actions at specified times, log brew results, and view a dashboard of meaningful visualizations and statistics to advance their brewing skills.
